### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Passionate about computer science and new technologies, I completed an apprenticeship in computer science at the Commune of Lausanne. After an enriching professional experience at the IT department of the Lausanne University Hospital, I decided to go back to school and obtaining a Technician ES diploma in application development. Subsequently, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in embedded computer science from the School of Engineering and Management of the Canton of Vaud (HEIG-VD).

Currently, I am studying in the Master's program in Embedded Computer Science at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland (HES-SO). My academic journey reflects my ongoing commitment to learning and developing in-depth skills in the field of computer science.
