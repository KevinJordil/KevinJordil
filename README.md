### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Passionate about computer science and new technologies, I completed an apprenticeship in computer science at the Commune of Lausanne. After an enriching professional experience at the IT department of the Lausanne University Hospital, I decided to go back to school and obtained a Technician ES diploma in application development. I then earned a Bachelor's degree in embedded computer science from the School of Engineering and Management of the Canton of Vaud (HEIG-VD).

Recently, I successfully completed a Master's degree in Embedded Computer Science at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland (HES-SO). I am now working as a developer at Swissdotnet SA. My academic and professional journey reflects my ongoing commitment to deepening my expertise in the field of computer science.

Please note that my public GitHub activity has decreased, as most of my contributions are now made within the scope of my professional work and are therefore in private repositories.
